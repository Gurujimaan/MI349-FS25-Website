                            <p>De-railed is a couch co-op game which can be played with upto 4 players. This project by two people, and I handled the entire core gameplay loop within it, from time mechanics to player controller, while my partner handled UI and Audio. It was also my first time trying out any form of multiplayer.</p>

                            <p>A recreation of the very first level of Pac-man. I worked on enemy AI heavily, as well as player controls. This project was an attempt to be as accurate as possible, even down to recreating the bugs present in the original.</p>

                            <p>A Print-n-Play board game made by me and two other colleagues. This was a heavy work towards my proficiency in Game Design. I worked towards many of the systems used in the game, and also created the final map through both historically accurate cities and game balance.</p>

                            <p>A small workit project made while I decided to have some fun and understand procedural animation. This build is not a game, but a display of a system that can be used within a game for adding animation without constraints.</p>
